    <h1>Let's Talk About My Background</h1>
    <p> Allow me to introduce myself. I am Mohammad Reza Nilchiyan, driven by an unwavering commitment to engineering excellence. My fervor lies in confronting complex challenges and immersing myself in projects that stretch beyond my comfort zone. The pivotal juncture of my career arrived when I chose to embark on the path of Electrical Engineering.

Influenced profoundly by luminaries such as Dr. Lotfi Aliasker Zadeh, Dr. Fazlollah Reza and Dr. Parviz Jabehdar-Maralani, I gravitated toward the realm of electrical and computer science. My academic tenure at Isfahan University heightened my interest in experimental electronics and the dynamics of power systems.

My academic journey led me to the prestigious University of Technology Malaysia(UTM). Here, I honed my expertise in Mechatronics and control systems, distinguishing myself in fields like Robotics and Digital Systems. My master's research, centered around Adaptive Control, amplified my prowess in computer programming.

This academic endeavor propelled me towards the grand pursuit of a Ph.D. in tandem with Professor Marzuki's trailblazing work in Artificial Intelligence. The convergence of his contributions and my aspirations established an ideal trajectory for my future.

The world of machine learning and research was seamlessly fused with my passion, emboldening my resolve to be embraced by a Doctoral Program. My propsal selected as best and I was selected for the Malaysia International Scholarship (MIS), an initiative by the Malaysian Government that aimed to attract brilliant minds from around the world to pursue postgraduate studies in Malaysia. This scholarship ran parallel to Malaysia's aspiration of emerging as a global center of academic excellence by attracting, motivating, and retaining talented human capital from abroad.

My journey will serve as evidence of my unwavering dedication to the forefront of engineering innovation, propelling me to shape a future that is characterized by excellence in the job market.</p>
