Presenting over 14 years of combined academic and industrial experience, I possess a track record in Electrical, Project Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine learning.

My educational journey commenced with a B.Sc. degree in Power Electronic Systems from Iran University of Esfahan (IAUN). Subsequently, I achieved an M.Sc. degree in Mechatronic and Automation Control Systems, followed by a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence from the esteemed University of Technology of Malaysia (UTM). These academic pursuits transpired within the realm of the Electrical faculty, spanning from 2003 to 2016. Notably, I attained the first rank throughout my academic endeavors, earning recognition as an international scholar by the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia (MIS). This distinction led me to a role as a Ph.D. researcher, focusing on artificial intelligence challenges at the Center of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIRO).

Upon graduation, I embraced a pivotal role as a chief engineer designer within a switchboard manufacturing company. My journey took an intriguing turn when an enticing job opportunity emerged in Austria. Motivated by this prospect, I relinquished my position at Powerwell Sdn. Bhd. to pursue this new venture.
